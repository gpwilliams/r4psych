The information in this book was informed by the R for Data Science book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), and by the Glasgow University Research Cycle by Dale Barr and Lisa DeBruine (https://gupsych.github.io/research_cycle/). These two resources have been very influential in the construction of this book and course (particularly joins from the GU Research Cycle and Data Visualisation 1 from R4DS). I encourage you to explore these options for further reading.
