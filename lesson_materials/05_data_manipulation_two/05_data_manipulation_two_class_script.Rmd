This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r install_lubridate}
# only run install.packages once per computer (uncomment if required)
# install.packages("lubridate")
```


```{r load_libraries_and_data, message = FALSE}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# load data
demo <- read_csv("inputs/lexical_decision_demographic_data_wide.csv")
```

# Lesson Code

See the columns and their data types in the `demo` data set.

```{r preview_demo_wide}
glimpse(demo)
```

Add other code chunks to run your R code with the insert R code chunk button above in RStudio. Press the green play button to run your code. Code will not execute in plain text (like this writing), this is simply text.
