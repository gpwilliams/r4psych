- Detailed notes available at [r4psych](glennwilliams.me/r4psych/)

- Download exercises from my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gpwilliams/r4psych/tree/master/lesson_materials)

- Join our [Slack Channel](https://rabertay.slack.com/)

Have fun!

## Installation and Setup

To get started, at the very least you'll have to download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). 

Select the correct distribution for your operating system and then click through to *install R for the first time*. 

For Windows users, you'll see a new page; at the top click on "Download R **[version number]** for Windows."

I can help here if needed!

## RStudio

- IDE for R: RStudio
- Download from the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/)

In the navigation panel:

1. Select **products** and choose **RStudio**.
2. Scroll down until you see **Download RStudio Desktop**. 
3. Click the **Download** button in the free tier and select the correct installer for your OS. 

## R Studio

  <p class="caption">The RStudio environment, with added highlights</p>
</div>

## Get your Working Directory

```{r 1_working_directory, results="hide"}
getwd()
```

This tells you where your current session is on your PC. It should look like C:/Users/YOUR_NAME/FOLDER/RFILE.R

## Load (Read) and Save (Write) Data

Use relative file paths to read and write data.

```{r 1_read_data_example, eval = FALSE}
# reads a CSV file from the Inputs folder
my_data <- read.csv("Inputs/my_data.csv") 

# writes a CSV file to the Outputs folder
my_data <- write.csv(my_data, "Outputs/my_data_again.csv") 
```

More on this in later lessons.

## Install Packages

In all classes we'll rely on the `tidyverse` family of functions. 

To install and load packages, run this code:

```{r 1_install_packages_example, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

This library has a number of packages which help with the entire data processing cycle.

## Objects and Functions

You can use R like a calculator, e.g.

```{r 1_calculator}
1 + 4
```

Enter directly in the console, or highlight and press Cntrl + Enter to execute.

*Top tip*: use the up and down arrow keys to cycle commands.

## Finishing Expressions

### + at the End of a Line

R will wait for you to finish an expression if you end a line with a +

```{r 1_looooooong_calculator}
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 +
  8 + 9
```

## Finishing Expressions

### Parsing Text (Quotes)

It'll also wait for you to close a quotation for strings.

```{r 1_parsing_text}
"Hello, world!"
"Hello, world (except you Donald Trump,
  nobody want's to talk to you)"
```

## Creating and Returning Variables

### Creating Variables

```{r 1_creating_variables}
summed_numbers <- 5 + 8
```
*Note*: You cannot include special characters or have numbers at the start of a name

### Returning Variables

```{r 1_returning_variables}
summed_numbers
```

## Creating and Returning Variables

### Performing Operations on Variables

R can work with your objects to perform functions. Here, multiplying `summed_numbers` by 5 is the same as multiplying (5 + 8) by 5.

```{r 1_performing_operations_on_variables}
summed_numbers*5
```

## Operations

R has the simple arithmetic operations, e.g.:  

* add `x + y`, 
* subtract `x - y`,
* multiply `x * y`
* divide `x/y`, 

R also has some logical operations built in. For example:

* less than or equal to `x <= y`
* exactly equal to `x == y`
* not equal to `x != y`
* x OR y `x | y`
* x AND y `x & y`

## Functions

R has a number of inbuilt functions, which can be expanded by loading new packages. 

Some basic arithmetic can be seen below:

```{r 1_sum_function}
sum(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

```{r 1_mean_function}
mean(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

## Functions

Functions are always followed by parentheses (e.g. `mean(), sum()`)

These functions work on raw numbers or stored numbers:

```{r 1_concatenating_values_in_a_variable}
stored_values <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
mean(stored_values)
```

## R is Vectorised

If you perform an operation on an entire object, it will apply to all elements within the object.

```{r 1_vectorised_work}
stored_values

stored_values + 1

stored_values / 10
```

## Creating and Accessing Data

We can create data using some inbuilt functions in R. 

Don't worry if this doesn't make sense; this is meant for other examples.

```{r 1_create_IQ_data}
# create participant IDs
participant <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 1)

# create pet ownership codes
set.seed(88)
pet <- sample(c("cat", "dog"), 100, replace = TRUE)

# create IQ scores
set.seed(88)
IQ_score <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 150, sd = 15)
IQ_score <- round(IQ_score) # round IQ scores
```

## Creating and Accessing Data

### Exploring Data

How many participants do we have?

```{r 1_length_function}
length(participant)
```

What if we have several observations?

```{r 1_non-unique_participant}
# assign the second value of participant the integer 1
participant[2] <- 1 

# return the first 6 values of the participant variable
head(participant) 
```

## Creating and Accessing Data

We can combine functions:

```{r 1_find_unique_participant}
length(unique(participant))
```

This asks R "how many unique values are in the variable participant?" 

**Answer**: 99.

## Creating and Accessing Data

#### Data Frames and Tibbles

We can store data together as a data frame or a tibble.

```{r 1_create_IQ_tibble}
IQ_data <- tibble::tibble(
  participant_number = participant, 
  pet_id = pet, 
  IQ = IQ_score
  )
```

Tibbles...

- don't automatically convert certain data types (e.g. string to factor).
- show the data type under the column name. 
- default to printing the first 10 rows of data when you type their name in the console. 

```{r 1_print_tibble}
IQ_data
```

## Converting to a data frame

Why? Some functions don't work with newer tibbles.

```{r 1_tibble_as_data_frame}
IQ_data_df <- as.data.frame(IQ_data)
head(IQ_data_df)
```

## Accessing Tibble Information

How do we calculate the mean? Not like this...

```{r 1_incorrect_mean_on_tibble}
mean(IQ_data)
```

Why? We didn't specify a column! Instead...

```{r 1_accessing_tibble_data, eval = FALSE}
# by name
IQ_data$IQ
IQ_data[["IQ"]]

# by position
IQ_data[[3]]
```

## Strict Tibbles

Tibbles always return a tibble.

```{r 1_rows_and_cols}
# tibble output
IQ_data[1, 3] # row 1, col 3

# data.frame output
IQ_data_df[1, 3]
```

## Working with Tibbles

### Calculate the mean

Be sure to select the correct column. I like to use `$` notation to do this.

```{r 1_correct_mean_on_tibble}
mean(IQ_data$IQ)
```

## Working with Tibbles

### Access multiple columns

R works with square brackets, i.e. `data[row, column]`, e.g.:

```{r 1_access_multiple_columns}
IQ_data[, c("participant_number", "IQ")]
```

## Working with Tibbles

### Access a range of values

```{r 1_access_rows_by_index}
IQ_data[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), c("participant_number", "IQ")]
```

## Working with Tibbles

### Access a range of values

Save on some typing...

```{r 1_access_rows_by_range}
IQ_data[1:5, c("participant_number", "IQ")]
```

More on this in *Session 4*.

## Manipulating Tibble Information

### Changing Values

Let's look at the data again.

```{r 1_view_tibble_data}
IQ_data
```

## Manipulating Tibble Information

### Changing Values

```{r 1_change_participant_number_back, eval = FALSE}
# specifying row and column by index
IQ_data[2, 1] <- 2

# specifying row by index and column by name
IQ_data[2, "participant_number"] <- 2

# specifying index within a column
IQ_data$participant_number[2] <- 2
```

## Manipulating Tibble Information

### Changing Values

We can do it this way.

```{r 1_change_participant_number_back_run}
IQ_data[2, 1] <- 2
head(IQ_data, 3)
```

## Adding and Removing Columns

Imagine we have data on operating systems used by our participants. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense yet; this is just for further examples.

```{r 1_sample_names}
set.seed(1000) # make the sampling procedure the same for us all

operating_system <- sample(c("windows", "mac", "linux"), 
                           size = 100, 
                           replace = TRUE,
                           prob = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)
                           )
```

## Adding and Removing Columns

### Add Column 

Set the column name to something you want to call it, then assign your data.

```{r 1_add_column}
IQ_data$operating_system <- operating_system
head(IQ_data)
```

## Adding and Removing Columns

### Remove Column

Set the column to nothing (NULL).

```{r 1_new_remove_column}
IQ_data$operating_system <- NULL # remove new column
head(IQ_data)
```

## Adding and Removing Rows

### Add Row

- Must have values for every cell
- We _need_ square data, so if you have missing rows, add an NA

```{r 1_add_new_row}
IQ_data[101, ] <- c(101, "dog", NA) # add new row with values
tail(IQ_data) # see last 6 rows
```

## Adding and Removing Rows

### Remove Row

Create the data from itself, minus the row you want to remove.

```{r 1_remove_new_row}
IQ_data <- IQ_data[-101, ] # remove the new row
tail(IQ_data) # see last 6 rows
```

More in *Session 4*...

## Other Data Types

### Lists

```{r 1_lists}
person_quality <- list(glenn = c("handsome", 
                                 "smart", 
                                 "modest"
                                 ),
                       not_glenn = c("less_handsome", 
                                     "less_smart", 
                                     "less_modest"
                                     )
                       )
```

## Other Data Types

### Lists

#### Access elements of a list:

```{r 1_access}
person_quality[1]
```

#### Access the values associated with an entry:

```{r 1_list_value_access}
person_quality[[1]]
```

## Other Data Types

### Lists

#### Edit list values

```{r 1_list_addition}
person_quality[[1]][4] <- "liar"
person_quality[1]
```

## Other Data Types

### Lists

- Why use lists? Data needn't be square, e.g.: 

```{r 1_add_to_list}
IQ_data[101, 1] <- 101
tail(IQ_data)
```

## Other Data Types

### Matrices

Can't mix data type.

```{r 1_matrix}
matrix_example <- matrix(rep(1: 25),
                         nrow = 5,
                         ncol = 5
                         )
matrix_example
```

I don't know why you'd use these...

## Good Practice

### Data Checking Tips

Use...

1. `ls()` or check global environment to see what you've created.
2. `class()` to find the class of an object(e.g. `class(IQ_data)`)
3. `str()` to see data types, structure, and observations (e.g. `str(IQ_data)`).

Check how your functions work if you're having difficulty:

- `?function_name()`, e.g. `?str()`
- Google, StackOverflow, etc...

## Good Practice

### Style

Use a style guide, it keeps you consistent and helps people to figure out your code:

[R Style Guide by Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)

- Use sensible variable names
- Use verbs to describe user-defined functions
- use a consistent style, like snake_case_here
- comment your code with descriptions of _why_ you've done something (how should be obvious)
