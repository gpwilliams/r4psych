# Overview

## Lesson Structure

In this session we'll cover reproducible reporting in RMarkdown.

Specifically, we'll cover:

- Calculating effect sizes from the *r* and *d* families
- Evaluating evidence for the null hypothesis
- Calculating 95% confidence intervals
- Simulation for understanding research practices
- Data and code archiving, and pre-registration on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)

## Getting Started

As always, we first need to load the `tidyverse` set of packages for this Chapter. We'll also need the **sjstats**, **effsize**, and **TOSTER** packages. The first two for effect sizes, and the last for doing equivalence tests.

```{r 10_load_packages, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sjstats)
library(effsize)
library(TOSTER)
```

```{r 10_load_packages_class, eval = FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(sjstats)
library(effsize)
library(TOSTER)
```

## Creating Reproducible Documents
### Creating a Reproducible Report

- R makes your analysis procedure clear - you write in code what you did!
- R makes re-calculating analyses quick and easy!
- Papers, presentations, or blog posts rely on you reporting statistics. Transcription introduces human error. Let's avoid this!
- If I can read your code, I can implement your methods easily

## Creating Reproducible Documents
### R Notebooks and Markdown Documents

You've already used R Notebooks:

- Instant updating of rendered document on saving
- Live preview of changes to the document
- Saved as an HTML document
- **But**, you can't save this as Word or HTML

## Creating Reproducible Documents
### R Notebooks and Markdown Documents

R Markdown documents are more flexible:

- Doesn't update rendered document on saving 
- No live preview
- **But**, flexible outputs; HTML, Word, PDF

Really, it just takes changing the document type from a notebook to an html/word document.
The code and text etc. remains the same! You just knit the file each time to render it.

## Creating Reproducible Documents
### How to make an RMarkdown file...

The same principles apply to all documents; name it and put your name in there.

e.g. `test_html_document`: title on rendering the document. 

<img src="../../../img/setting_markdown_options.png"; style="max-width:450px">

## Creating Reproducible Documents
### How to make an RMarkdown file...

- Save the document somewhere
- change code and text; code chunks for code, plain text for writing.
- formatting text is done via markdown, e.g. \*\*bold text\*\*
- plenty of cheat sheets out there -- see this chapter for that!

## Creating Reproducible Documents
### How to make an RMarkdown file...

- Knit the document to make it render 
- Errors in code = fail to knit; but tells you the line where it fails!
- See output in RStudio, or double click output (e.g. HTML document)

## Folder Structure for Reproducible Analyses

- 1 experiment, 1 folder
- subfolders for different tasks; Data, Analysis, Outputs
- use **relative** file paths to read data from other folders, e.g.

```{r 10_read_above_folder, eval = FALSE}
data <- read_csv("../Data/raw_data.csv")
```

Say we're in the **Analysis** folder, this goes up one out of that folder, then looks in the **Data** folder, finally reading in the **raw_data.csv** file.

## Folder Structure for Reproducible Analyses

- Edit your RMarkdown file in the **Analysis** folder, then...
- Render it in the **Outputs** folder by creating and running another R script (not RMarkdown, R). 

This just needs the following line:

```{r 10_render_html, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render('test_html_document.Rmd', 
                  output_file = '../Output/test_html_document.html'
                  )
```

- Real example in your **lesson_materials** folder

## Creating Reproducible Documents
### Tables

How to make it a table from a data frame? Kable it!

```{r 10_kable}
# make example data
tooth_dat <- ToothGrowth %>% group_by(supp) %>% summarise(mean_len = mean(len))
# print table
library(knitr)
kable(tooth_dat) 
```

It's that simple. There are more ways to customise, but details of that are online.

## Creating Reproducible Documents
### Using R Markdown Templates

- There are several document templates out there. Check GitHub and google for examples
- Papaja is for 6th Edition APA paper templates
- When installing from GitHub, you will need devtools installed

```{r 10_papaja, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja")
```

*We won't use this here, but it's good to know about templates*.

## Creating Reproducible Documents
### Using R Markdown Templates

With any document, you can make your own reference file, e.g. references.bib
- typically used for LaTeX documents
- any reference manager should make a .bib file for you.
- put the .bib file in the same folder as your Rmarkdown script, load in the YAML header, e.g.

```{}
---
title: "Sample Document"
output: html_document
bibliography: bibliography.bib
---
```

## Open Science

If you have reproducible analyses, you may as well go the whole way.

- **Reproducible reports**: code included and used for analyses/plots
- **Pre-prints**: repository, e.g. [PsyAr$\chi$iv](https://psyarxiv.com/) -- get instant feedback, open to anyone to read.
- **Pre-registration and registered reports**: full analysis plan (including outliers, $\alpha$-level, sample size justification) and hypotheses. Distinguishes exploratory from confirmatory research, formalises type-I error rate. AsPredicted.org/OSF for this. **Let me convince you about this!**

## Open Science

- **Open access publishing**: Let tax payers see the result of their taxes.
- **Open materials, data, and code**: Share everything. You have back ups, can check errors, or learn from others.

Crucial: **README** file (can be plain text) explaining all variables and how to understand data etc.

## What to Report

- We've covered inferential and descriptive statistics, as well as plots
- Want to know if we should *care* if something is significant:
  - Effect sizes: can be raw or standardised, raw is provided by parameter estimates, so we'll look at standardised
  - Measure of uncertainty around estimates: e.g. 95% confidence interval from model fit
  - Whether the null is evidence of absence
  
## Effect Sizes

Why report standardised effect size? 

- Allows comparison across studies/designs
- Crucial for meta-analysis
- Useful for analytic power analyses (i.e. not simulation-based (although possible here too))

We saw $r$ and $r^2$ in correlation. But what about *t*-tests and ANOVA?

- **sjstats** package for ANOVA and linear regression models
- **effsize** package for *t*-tests

## Cohen's d and Pearson's r

2 families of effect sizes: $d$ and $r$

$d$ = **standardised mean differences**. These go from 0 (no effect) to $\infty$ (infinity)
- e.g. Cohen's $d$ = differences between group scores divided by pooled $SD$

Different forms, e.g. 

- *d*~z~ for within-subjects designs
- *d*~av~ for within-subjects designs corrected for correlations between measures
- Hedge's *g* for unbiased form (don't know population $SD$). Better for small sample sizes, and doesn't overstate effect sizes as much.

The choice is up to you!

## Cohen's d and Pearson's r

2 families of effect sizes: $d$ and $r$

$r$ = **strength of association between variables**. Goes from 0 (no association) to 1 (complete association). Sum of squared differences between observations and the mean.

Different forms, e.g.

- $\eta^2$ (eta squared) for more than 2 sets of observations;
- $\omega^2$ (omega squared) corrects due to not knowing population variance. Better for small samples/many levels.
- $\epsilon^2$ (epsilon squared), possibly the least biased.

Have partial forms (which don't sum to 100%) to explain variance explained by 1 factor independently.

## Cohen's d and Pearson's r 

- Cohen's $d$ is typically less biased than Pearson's $r$ for uneven sample sizes
- But $r$ is typically easier to understand.
- For both, avoid benchmarks in planning your studies! Use the literature, but beware of **publication bias** which overstates effect sizes

## Effect sizes
### Cohen's d and Hedge's g

Make some data for a *t*-test

```{r 10_make_t_test_data}
set.seed(5)
ind_t_data <- tibble(
  dv = c(rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 100, sd = 10),
         rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 99, sd = 10)),
  id = c(rep("a", 10000), rep("b", 10000))
  )
ind_t_data %>% group_by(id) %>% summarise(mean_dv = mean(dv))
```

## Effect sizes
### Cohen's d and Hedge's g 

Look at the reults of an independent-sample *t*-test. Do we really care? That mean difference was tiny!

```{r 10_t_test}
t.test(dv ~ id, data = ind_t_data)
```

## Effect sizes
### Cohen's d and Hedge's g 

Use the `cohen.d()` function. How do results change with and without Hedge's correction?

```{r 10_cohen_d}
cohen.d(dv ~ id, paired = F, hedges.correction = T, data = ind_t_data)
```

## Effect sizes
### Eta Squared and Omega Squared

First, make some data for a 3 by 2 ANOVA.
 
```{r 10_tooth_data}
# load the data
data("ToothGrowth")
# convert to tibble and make dose a factor
tooth <- ToothGrowth %>%
  mutate(dose = factor(dose)) %>%
  as.tibble()
# see the output
tooth
```

## Effect sizes
### Eta Squared and Omega Squared

Next, we'll fit a linear model to the data.

```{r 10_tooth_summary}
tooth_aov <- aov(len ~ supp * dose, data = tooth)
summary(tooth_aov)
```

## Effect sizes
### Eta Squared

First, we'll calculate $\eta^2$.

```{r 10_eta_sq}
eta_sq(tooth_aov, partial = F)
```

## Effect sizes
### Omega Squared

Then we'll calculate $\omega^2$. 

Try changing the partial argument of both to see how it affects results.

```{r 10_omega_sq}
omega_sq(tooth_aov, partial = F)
```

## Confidence Intervals

- Report the confidence intervals around your parameter estimates as a measure of uncertainty.
- This is easy to do for any fitted model object (e.g. our ANOVA before).
- Different methods to calculate; bootstrapping generally seen as the best.

```{r 10_confint}
confint(tooth_aov, method = "boot")
```

## Evaluating Evidence for the Null Hypothesis

- What about when you have a non-significant result? That **doesn't** mean there's no difference in the population.
- How do you evaluate whether samples are equivalent (e.g. group 1 is practically the same as group 2)?
- One method in NHST is equivalence testing; e.g. the TOST procedure
- TOST = two one-sided tests. 

## The TOST Procedure

- Set your upper and lower bounds for differences between groups of scores
- This is the boundary within which you say the samples are equivalent
- e.g. group 1 mean = 10, group 2 = 11, if the lower bound is 8 and upper 12, these are equivalent.
- You're basically saying you don't care about the small differences between groups, but you're putting a number to what is "small"

## The TOST Procedure

- You ask; is this score the same as the upper bound? Is it the same as the lower?
- 2 null hypotheses: one is the effect is less than or equal to the lower bound, the other is the effect is more than or equal to the upper bound
- non-significant effect = scores aren't within the bounds, i.e. there is a true effect
- significant effect = scores are within the bounds, i.e. they are equivalent

## TOST for the independent t-test

Remember the data from before?

```{r 10_tost_group_summary}
ind_t_data %>% group_by(id) %>% summarise(mean_dv = mean(dv))
```

## TOST for the independent t-test

Make a summary of your data by group.

```{r 10_tost_descriptives}
# make a summary
ind_summary <- ind_t_data %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dv),
            sd = sd(dv),
            n = n()
            )
ind_summary # return the summary
```

## TOST for the independent t-test; raw scores

Run the TOST; `with()` means we don't keep doing `data$column`

```{r 10_tost_raw_code, eval = FALSE}
with(ind_summary, 
     TOSTtwo.raw(m1 = mean[1],
                 m2 = mean[2],
                 sd1 = sd[1],
                 sd2 = sd[2],
                 n1 = n[1],
                 n2 = n[2],
                 low_eqbound = -2,
                 high_eqbound = 2, 
                 alpha = 0.05, 
                 var.equal = TRUE
                 )
     )
```

## TOST for the independent t-test; raw scores

```{r 10_tost_raw, echo = FALSE}
with(ind_summary, 
     TOSTtwo.raw(m1 = mean[1],
                 m2 = mean[2],
                 sd1 = sd[1],
                 sd2 = sd[2],
                 n1 = n[1],
                 n2 = n[2],
                 low_eqbound = -2,
                 high_eqbound = 2, 
                 alpha = 0.05, 
                 var.equal = TRUE
                 )
     )
```

## TOST for the independent t-test

We get an output of regular NHST *t*-tests, as well as TOST *t*-tests
- *t*-test (NHST) was significant
- TOST was significant in both directions
- i.e. statistically significant, but practically meaningless

## TOST for the independent t-test; effect sizes

```{r 10_tost_effect_size_code, eval = FALSE}
TOSTtwo(
  m1 = 100,
  m2 = 101,
  sd1 = 9,
  sd2 = 8.1,
  n1 = 192,
  n2 = 191,
  low_eqbound_d = -0.3, 
  high_eqbound_d = 0.3, 
  alpha = 0.05, 
  var.equal = FALSE
  )
```

## TOST for the independent t-test; effect sizes

```{r 10_tost_effect_size, echo = FALSE}
TOSTtwo(
  m1 = 100,
  m2 = 101,
  sd1 = 9,
  sd2 = 8.1,
  n1 = 192,
  n2 = 191,
  low_eqbound_d = -0.3, 
  high_eqbound_d = 0.3, 
  alpha = 0.05, 
  var.equal = FALSE
  )
```

## TOST for the independent t-test

- *t*-test was non-significant
- TOST was significant
- no significant difference, and groups are equivalent

This was a crash course in the TOST. Check Daniel Lakens' work for a primer on this.

## Understanding Problematic Design Choices

Final part of the course. 

- Why do you need to consider pre-registration? It helps you to not fool yourself!
- We'll look at flexible analysis; specifically optional stopping
- Strength of NHST is when we stick to your plan.
- More freedom = increased type-I errors (dodgy conclusions commence!)

## Understanding Problematic Design Choices

- Run the optional stopping functions in your class script.

```{r 10_optional_stopping_functions, echo = FALSE}
# sample data and make a tibble with DV and ID based on input group sample size
# this is fixed at means of 100 and sd of 15 for each group
sample_groups <- function(n_group){
  group_one <- rnorm(n = n_group, mean = 100, sd = 15)
  group_two <- rnorm(n = n_group, mean = 100, sd = 15)
  data <- tibble(dv = c(group_one, group_two),
                 id = c(rep("group_one", n_group),
                        rep("group_two", n_group)
                        )
  )
}

# run a t-test and extract the p-value for a tibble
# columns must be named dv and id for dependent variables and group ID
test_groups <- function(tibble_data) {
  test <- t.test(dv ~ id, data = tibble_data, paired = FALSE)
  test$p.value
}

# optional stopping without correction:
# sample data and extract p-values from a t-test
# if non-significant, sample additional people and retest
bias_test <- function(sample_size, additional_n) {
  original_data <- sample_groups(sample_size)
  p_val <- test_groups(original_data)
  ifelse(p_val >= .05, 
         p_val <- test_groups(
           rbind(original_data, sample_groups(additional_n))
           ),
         p_val
         )
}
```

- Run a test with 30 people in each group. If it comes up non-significant, recruit another 10 and re-test.
- What happens to the number of *p*-values below the .05 threshold? 
- Remember, under the null (assumed here), they should be evenly distributed (i.e. 5% below .05 $\alpha$-level)

```{r 10_optional_stopping_p_val}
set.seed(100) # uncomment if you want different values each time
p_vals <- replicate(n = 1000, bias_test(30, 10))
mean(p_vals < .05)
```

## Understanding Problematic Design Choices
### Optional Stopping (Without Correction)

Let's plot these *p*-values. They aren't evenly distributed!
- Easy fix, **Bonferroni correction**: multiply your *p*-value by the number of times you tested.

## Understanding Problematic Design Choices
### Optional Stopping (Without Correction)

```{r 10_optional_stopping_plot_code, eval = FALSE}
p_plot <- ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(p_vals),
                 binwidth = 0.05,
                 boundary = 0,
                 fill = "white",
                 colour = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), 
                     breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.05)
                     ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.05, linetype = 2, colour = "red") +
  labs(x = "p-value") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=8))
p_plot
```

## Understanding Problematic Design Choices
### Optional Stopping (Without Correction)

```{r 10_optional_stopping_plot, echo = FALSE}
p_plot <- ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(p_vals),
                 binwidth = 0.05,
                 boundary = 0,
                 fill = "white",
                 colour = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), 
                     breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.05)
                     ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.05, linetype = 2, colour = "red") +
  labs(x = "p-value") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=8))
p_plot
```

## Understanding Problematic Design Choices

The final lesson: good statistics can't save you from bad hypotheses.

- Run the function that tests for the probability of a positive result being a true effect
- Default parameters: 90% power, $\alpha$-level of 5%, chance of hypothesis being true is 1%.

```{r 10_test_true_hyp_function, echo = FALSE}
test_prob_hyp_true <- function(power = 0.90, alpha = 0.05, hyp_chance = 0.01){
  # calculate probabilities
  prob_false <- 1 - hyp_chance
  prob_positive <- power * hyp_chance + alpha * prob_false
  prob_positive_is_true <- power * hyp_chance / prob_positive
  
  # output probability of a positive result being true
  print(paste("There is a", 
              round(prob_positive_is_true*100, 2), 
              "% chance of a positive result being true.")
  )
}
```

```{r 10_test_prob_true_default}
test_prob_hyp_true()
```
