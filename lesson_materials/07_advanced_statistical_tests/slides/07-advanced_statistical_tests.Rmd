# Overview

## Lesson Structure

In this session, we'll cover more advanced statistical tests, such as multifactorial experiments and experiments with factors of more than 2 levels. 

Specifically, we'll cover:

- multilevel and multifactorial ANOVA
- multilevel and multiple regression
- factor coding (and why it matters in R)
- sum of squares (and why this matters in R)

## Getting Started

As always, we first need to load the `tidyverse` set of packages for this Chapter.

```{r 7_load_packages, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r 7_load_packages_class, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Generate Data

### Numerical Stroop Data

```{r 7_data_gen}
set.seed(1000)
stroop_dat <- tibble(
  subject = seq(1:60),
  congruent = rnorm(mean = 400, sd = 30, n = 60),
  incongruent = congruent + rnorm(mean = 60, sd = 10, n = 60),
  neutral = congruent + rnorm(mean = 30, sd = 10, n = 60)
  ) %>%
  gather(key = cond, value = reaction_time, 2:4) %>% 
  mutate(
    cond = as.factor(cond),
    log_RT = log(reaction_time)
  )
```

## Generate Data

### Smoking Data

```{r 7_data_gen_2}
# set parameters
set.seed(1000)
means <- rep(c(80, 80, 100), 100)
sds <- rep(c(5, 5, 7), 100)

# simulate data
cond <- rep(c("control", "drug_one", "drug_two"), 100)
subject <- seq(1:300)

smoking_dat <- tibble(
  subject = subject,
  cond = as.factor(cond),
  outcome = rnorm(n = 300, mean = means, sd = sds)
)
```

# Multilevel Linear Models
## Multilevel Linear Models
### Considering your Coding 

We can ask different questions of our data, which we define by our contrast codes. 
This is particularly important when we have more than 1 factor in our model.

- Simple effect (e.g. several drugs against reference placebo): treatment coding
- Main effect (e.g. individual level against grand mean): sum/deviation coding

## Checking your Levels

Factor data allows us to do some cool things, like checking levels easily, or assigning contrast codes.

```{r 7_check_levels}
levels(stroop_dat$cond)
levels(smoking_dat$cond)
```

*Note*: If your data isn't stored as a factor, use `as.factor()` or `factor()` on your variable.

## Contrast Matrices

```{r 7_contrast_matrices}
# make data 2 levels and convert condition to a factor
stroop_subset <- stroop_dat %>% 
  filter(cond %in% c("congruent", "incongruent")) %>% 
  mutate(cond = factor(cond))

# see your contrasts
contrasts(stroop_subset$cond)
```

## Fitting a Simple Model

```{r 7_fitting_simple_model}
lm(log_RT ~ cond, stroop_subset) %>% summary()
```

Parameter estimates in main body of model, model fit below.

## Understanding the Simple Model

- Intercept parameter estimate = 5.979, 
- Congruent condition adds 0.145 to 5.979, which sums to `r 5.979 + 0.145`
- How does this equate to our mean scores?

```{r 7_understanding_model_estimates}
stroop_subset %>% 
  group_by(cond) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(log_RT))
```

## Redefining your Contrasts

- `contrasts()` allows us to see how our data is represented. Redefine with the `contr.` family of functions.
- e.g. `contr.sum`, `contr.helmert`, `contr.poly`

```{r 7_redefine_contrasts_sum}
contrasts(stroop_subset$cond) <- contr.sum
contrasts(stroop_subset$cond)
```

Now sums to 0, which is the intercept in any linear model. Hence, intercept is the mean across both levels.

## Modelling our Redefined Contrasts

```{r 7_refitting_sum_model}
lm(log_RT ~ cond, stroop_subset) %>% summary()
```

## Understanding our New Parameter Estimates

- Intercept is the grand mean
- condition (now labelled `cond1`; the first (and only) contrast in our contrast matrix for condition) is -0.073

```{r 7_understanding_sum_estimates}
stroop_subset %>% summarise(mean = mean(log_RT))
```

With only 2 levels, coding scheme doesn't affect interpretation of condition effect (only parameter estimates).

## Multilevel Regression

What happens if we have some more complex data? Let's look at the contrast matrix for the full Stroop data:

```{r 7_multilevel_regression_contrasts}
contrasts(stroop_dat$cond)
```

- Congruent row sums to 0, hence it is the intercept. Others sum to 1. 

## Multilevel Regression

```{r 7_multilevel_regression_model}
lm(log_RT ~ cond, data = stroop_dat) %>% summary
```

## Modelling our Multilevel Model

- Intercept = congruent condition
- incongruent condition (cond2) is the difference between the intercept mean and that incongruent level's mean.
- and neutral condition (cond3) is the difference between the intercept mean and that neutral level's mean

```{r 7_multilevel_regression_means}
stroop_dat %>% group_by(cond) %>% summarise(mean = mean(log_RT))
```

## Recoding our Multilevel Model

As before, we can ask for sum-coded effects.
Now no row sums to 0, but all columns sum to 0.

```{r 7_sum_coding_factors}
contrasts(stroop_dat$cond) <- contr.sum
contrasts(stroop_dat$cond)
```

## Understanding our New Parameter Estimates

- Intercept = grand mean
- incongruent condition (cond2) is the difference between the intercept mean and that incongruent level's mean.
- and neutral condition (cond3) is the difference between the intercept mean and that neutral level's mean
- Crucially, main effect of the model is unchanged

## Understanding our New Parameter Estimates

```{r 7_understanding_sum_coded_estimates}
lm(log_RT ~ cond, data = stroop_dat) %>% summary
```

## Changing Intercept Orders

- Reset the data back to treatment coded effects.
- Make the condition variable a factor of itself, but specify your levels manually.
- First one in order is intercept (usually defaults to alphabetic order)

```{r 7_changing_treatment_order}
contrasts(stroop_dat$cond) <- contr.treatment
stroop_dat$cond <- factor(stroop_dat$cond, 
                          levels = c("neutral", "congruent", "incongruent")
                          )
```

## Changing Intercept Orders

```{r 7_contrasts_treatment}
contrasts(stroop_dat$cond)
```

## Refitting with a New Reference

```{r 7_refitting_treatment_model}
lm(log_RT ~ cond, data = stroop_dat) %>% summary
```

# Multilevel ANOVA
## Multilevel ANOVA

- `aov()` is just a wrapper around the `lm()` function
- this gives us main effects and interactions, rather than parameter estimates
- how does this work? they're both the general linear model!

```{r 7_multilevel_anova}
stroop_aov <- aov(log_RT ~ cond, data = stroop_dat)
summary(stroop_aov)
```

...they're so similar, we can even ask for linear model results from our ANOVA model fit.

## Multilevel ANOVA

```{r 7_multilevel_anova_summary}
summary.lm(stroop_aov)
```

## Multiple Contrasts

- You may have notices treatment coding doesn't give us all contrasts
- i.e. we get A vs B, and A vs. C, but what about B vs. C?

## Multiple Contrasts

```{r 7_multilevel_multiple_contrasts}
smoking_lm <- lm(outcome ~ cond, data = smoking_dat)
summary(smoking_lm)
```

## Multiple Contrasts

2 options: (1) relevel factor, (2) calculate differences in original model fit. We'll do (1);

```{r 7_relevel_factor_multiple_contrasts}
smoking_dat$cond <- factor(smoking_dat$cond, 
                           levels = c("drug_one", "drug_two", "control")
                           )
smoking_lm2 <- lm(outcome ~ cond, data = smoking_dat)
```

## Multiple Contrasts

```{r 7_summary_of_multiple_contrasts}
summary(smoking_lm2)
```

# Multifactorial Analyses
## Multifactorial Analyses
### 3-level Factors

We'll use the inbuilt ToothGrowth data set, which looks at the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs. 
This data set has 3 columns:

- len: tooth length
- supp: supplement type (vitamin C supplement or orange juice)
- dose: strength of dose (0.5, 1, 2)

## Load the Data

```{r 7_load_tooth_data}
# load the data
data("ToothGrowth")

# convert to tibble and make dose a factor
tooth <- ToothGrowth %>%
  mutate(dose = factor(dose)) %>%
  as.tibble()

# see the output
tooth
```

## Multifactorial ANOVA

We want main effects and interactions. Check for more main effects by adding them to the formula like so:

`dependent variable ~ factor_one + factor_two`

To check for an interaction, we specify it like so:

`dependent variable ~ factor_one + factor_two + factor_one : factor_two`

Or, to save on typing, like so (these two are equivalent):

`dependent variable ~ factor_one * factor_two`

## Multifactorial ANOVA

We don't need to worry about contrast matrix for simple ANOVA output (but we do for unbalanced designs/model coefficients; more on the first point later).

Save the model fit as **tooth_aov** as we want to do some follow up tests later on.

```{r 7_fit_tooth_data_anova}
tooth_aov <- aov(len ~ supp * dose, data = tooth)
summary(tooth_aov)
```

## Multifactorial ANOVA

Significant effect of all factors, check with plot.

```{r 7_plot_tooth_data}
ggplot(data = tooth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len, colour = supp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Multiple Comparisons

1 option: Tukey Honest Significant Difference: `TukeyHSD()`
- Apply to our fitted model **tooth_aov**
- Also have to specify the confidence level, which is by default 95%

```{r 7_tukey_comparisons}
TukeyHSD(tooth_aov, conf.level = 0.95)
```

## Multiple Comparisons (So Much Output!)

You can cut down on the output by asking for just the interaction terms:

```{r 7_tukey_comparisons_subset}
tukey_aov <- TukeyHSD(tooth_aov, conf.level = 0.95)
tukey_aov$`supp:dose`
```

# Multiple Regression
## Multiple Regression

- A little more complex if you want parameter estimates. Easiest to use `aov()`
- Still, can assess main effects by improvement to model fit
- Need to set up contrast codes manually, then...
- compare models with and without the coded factors included

```{r 7_centered_variables}
# code new centered variables
tooth$supp_dev <- (tooth$supp == "VC") - mean(tooth$supp == "VC")
tooth$dose_dev_one <- (tooth$dose == "0.5") - mean(tooth$dose == "0.5")
tooth$dose_dev_two <- (tooth$dose == "1") - mean(tooth$dose == "1")
```

## Multiple Regression

```{r 7_see_centered_variables}
tooth # inspect changes
```

## Model Comparisons

Fit a full model with both factors (notice parentheses)

```{r 7_fit_full_model}
tooth_lm_full <- lm(len ~ supp_dev * (dose_dev_one + dose_dev_two), data = tooth)
```

## Model Comparisons

Next, we construct a reduced model, and use the `anova()` function to compare the two models against one another. Does the interaction improve our model?

```{r 7_fit_reduced_model}
tooth_lm_reduced <- lm(len ~ supp_dev + (dose_dev_one + dose_dev_two), data = tooth)
anova(tooth_lm_full, tooth_lm_reduced)
```

## Exploring Interactions

- One way is to run multiple t-tests, adjusting *p*-value for inflation
- Need a column which makes combinations of factor levels
- Make this with `interaction()`

```{r 7_make_interaction_column}
# create combined factor column
tooth$interact <- interaction(tooth$supp, tooth$dose)

# check levels of our new factor
levels(tooth$interact)
```

## Exploring Interactions

- Conduct pairwise *t*-tests with `pairwise.t.test()`
- If you want more information, just fit models on subsets of your data and adjust your *p*-value accordingly

```{r 7_pairwise_t_tests}
pairwise.t.test(tooth$len, tooth$interact)
```

## Multifactorial Analyses
### 2-level Factors

- Easier than 3 level factors, as centred variables are easy to interpret
- Simply ask, what is the effect of this variable on the mean?
- One condition is assigned negative sign, the other positive (e.g. -1/1)
- Direction of effect (i.e. +/- sign) indicates condition effect

## Make Data

Let's just look at the 0.5 and 1 doses. Imagine this was the original data set.

```{r 7_make_multifactorial_data_tooth_sub}
tooth_sub <- tooth %>% 
  dplyr::select(1 : 3) %>%
  filter(dose %in% c(0.5, 1)) %>%
  mutate(dose = factor(dose))
tooth_sub # look at the data
```

## Fit Model

### Main Effects

As always, set your coding for main effects:

```{r 7_tooth_to_sum_coded}
contrasts(tooth_sub$supp) <- contr.sum
contrasts(tooth_sub$dose) <- contr.sum
```

Then we can fit the model again.

```{r 7_refit_tooth_sum}
tooth_sub_lm <- lm(len ~ supp * dose, data = tooth_sub)
```

## Fit Model

### Main Effects

See the model output.

```{r 7_summary_tooth_sum}
summary(tooth_sub_lm)
```

## Fit Model

### Simple Effects

```{r 7_tooth_to_treatment_codes}
contrasts(tooth_sub$supp) <- contr.treatment
contrasts(tooth_sub$supp)
```

- OJ will now be our reference value for the intercept 
- dose will be compared at this intercept value, so we now have simple effects of dose, and main effects of supplement
- interaction term remains the same regardless of our coding approach

## Fit Model

### Simple Effects

```{r 7_model_tooth_treatment}
tooth_sub_lm2 <- lm(len ~ supp * dose, data = tooth_sub)
summary(tooth_sub_lm2)
```

## Mixed Analyses

- Simulate smoking data (just copy and paste this code)

```{r 7_make_data_for_mixed_analysis}
set.seed(1000)
means <- rep(c(80, 85), 100)
sds <- rep(c(5, 5, 7), 100)
cond <- rep(c("control", "drug_one"), 100)
subject <- seq(1:200)
smoking_dat_extra <- tibble(
  subject = subject,
  cond = as.factor(cond),
  time_one = rnorm(n = 200, mean = means, sd = sds),
  time_two = time_one + rnorm(n = 200, mean = 5, sd = sds)
  ) %>%
  gather(key = test_time, value = recovery, 3:4) %>%
  mutate(test_time = as.factor(test_time)) %>%
  arrange(subject)
```

## Mixed Analyses

- Make smoking data (just copy and paste this code)

```{r 7_view_new_mixed_data}
# view the data
smoking_dat_extra
```

## Mixed Linear Models

Set contrasts...

```{r 7_define_mixed_data_sum_contrasts}
contrasts(smoking_dat_extra$cond) <- contr.sum
contrasts(smoking_dat_extra$test_time) <- contr.sum
```

then, refit the model as before:

```{r 7_fit_mixed_sum_coded_model}
mixed_lm <- lm(recovery ~ cond * test_time, data = smoking_dat_extra)
```

## Mixed Linear Models

```{r 7_mixed_linear_model}
summary(mixed_lm) # see model output
```

## Mixed Linear Models

**Problem**: `lm()` doesn't account for subject-variability. Can't account for within-subjects design here. 

Fix by using:
- `aov()` function with error terms (as in previous lessons -- remember this is just a wrapper for `lm()`)
- **linear mixed effects models** with random effects by participant (future lessons)

## Mixed ANOVA

Simply define error term as test time within subjects for within-subjects effect only.

```{r 7_mixed_anova}
mixed_aov <- aov(recovery ~ cond * test_time + 
                   Error(subject/test_time), 
                 data = smoking_dat_extra)
```

## Mixed ANOVA

```{r 7_mixed_anova_summary}
summary(mixed_aov) # see model output
```

## A Note on Sum of Squares

For unbalanced designs, how the sum of squares is calculated has a big effect on interpretations

- **type-I** = R's default, order matters, determine variance by first term in model, then second etc. First thus gets most variance.
- **type-II** = main effects get variance, not interactions. Contrast coding doesn't matter.
- **type-III** = SPSS's default. Determines variance for all factors including interaction together. Needs orthogonal contrast codes (e.g. `contr.sum`)

## A Note on Sum of Squares

Make some unbalanced data from the **tooth_sub** data.

```{r 7_make_subset_tooth}
tooth_sub_unbalanced <- tooth_sub[2:40,]
head(tooth_sub_unbalanced) # see the data
```

## A Note on Sum of Squares

Fit with **supp** first:

```{r 7_tooth_supp_first}
supp_first <- aov(len ~ supp * dose, data = tooth_sub_unbalanced)
summary(supp_first)
```

## A Note on Sum of Squares

Fit with **dose** first:

```{r 7_tooth_supp_second}
dose_first <- aov(len ~ dose * supp, data = tooth_sub_unbalanced)
summary(dose_first)
```

## A Note on Sum of Squares

Use the `Anova()` function from the **car** package (capital A in `Anova()`!)
- Defaults to type-II sum of squares, so ask for type-III!

```{r 7_install_load_car, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("car") # install once per machine
library(car) # load each time you open R
```

## A Note on Sum of Squares

- Equivalent results with type-III sum of squares:

```{r 7_type_III_sum_of_squares_supp_first}
Anova(supp_first, type = "III")
```

## A Note on Sum of Squares

- Equivalent results with type-III sum of squares:

```{r 7_type_III_sum_of_squares_supp_second}
Anova(dose_first, type = "III")
```
